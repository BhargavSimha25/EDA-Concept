# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA-1) 🔍

Welcome to the **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA-1)** repository! This project is dedicated to providing resources and tools for performing comprehensive exploratory data analysis, a crucial step in understanding and preparing data for further analysis and modeling.

## 📚 Overview

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) involves analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics, often using visual methods. EDA helps identify patterns, detect anomalies, and check assumptions, guiding the next steps in data processing and modeling.

## 📖 Contents

### 1. **Introduction to EDA** 📘
   - **What is EDA?:** Understand the purpose and importance of exploratory data analysis in the data science workflow.
   - **EDA Objectives:** Learn about the key goals of EDA, including data summarization, visualization, and cleaning.

### 2. **Data Cleaning** 🧹
   - **Handling Missing Values:** Techniques for dealing with missing or incomplete data (e.g., imputation, removal).
   - **Removing Duplicates:** Identify and eliminate duplicate records to ensure data integrity.
   - **Outlier Detection:** Methods for detecting and handling outliers that may affect analysis.

### 3. **Data Visualization** 📊
   - **Univariate Analysis:** Visualize individual features using histograms, bar plots, and box plots.
   - **Bivariate Analysis:** Explore relationships between two variables with scatter plots, line graphs, and correlation matrices.
   - **Multivariate Analysis:** Use techniques like pair plots and heatmaps to understand interactions between multiple variables.

### 4. **Descriptive Statistics** 📈
   - **Central Tendency Measures:** Calculate mean, median, and mode to understand the data's central values.
   - **Dispersion Measures:** Assess variance, standard deviation, and range to gauge the spread of data.
   - **Distribution Shape:** Analyze skewness and kurtosis to understand the shape of the data distribution.

### 5. **Feature Engineering** ⚙️
   - **Creating New Features:** Derive new features from existing data to enhance model performance.
   - **Feature Scaling:** Apply normalization and standardization to prepare features for modeling.
   - **Feature Selection:** Identify the most important features for your analysis to improve model efficiency.

### 6. **Correlation Analysis** 🔗
   - **Correlation Coefficients:** Calculate Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall correlations to understand variable relationships.
   - **Correlation Heatmaps:** Visualize correlations between multiple features to identify potential multicollinearity.
