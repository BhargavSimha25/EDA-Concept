Introduction
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a critical step in the data analysis process, allowing you to uncover patterns, spot anomalies, frame hypotheses, and check assumptions through summary statistics and graphical representations. This repository aims to equip you with the skills and knowledge to perform EDA confidently and effectively.

Examples
We have included several examples to demonstrate the application of EDA techniques:

Basic EDA: An introduction to basic EDA techniques, including summary statistics and simple visualizations.
Data Cleaning: Methods to clean and preprocess data before analysis.
Advanced Visualizations: Techniques to create insightful visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Case Studies: Real-world examples showcasing EDA on various datasets from different domains.
